# App-Code-Design

StockPile is an Android app designed for adding, removing, and tracking the quantities of items in an inventory. When the quantity of an item drops below a threshold, a text is sent to remind the owner to restock.
UI was designed for the user to log in, view a list of the items, and add, remove, or adjust the onhand of the item.
I chose to implement a recycler view for UI to show each listed item. I also created a database to store usernames and passwords in key pairs and a separate database for tracking items and their quantities.
To test the code I set each UI screen as the main screen individually until each could be fully functional and accessed through the use of the app.
One of the challenges I had to overcome in this project was in the use of SQL databases. Intentionally creating a different database type for inventory than was used for usernames and passwords.
UI design was easily my favorite part of this project. Creating layouts, setting styles, and setting backgrounds and themes gave a sense of creating something tangible.
